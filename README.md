# Compiler-Design

A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program. It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time and space.

**List of Experiments:**<br/>
•	First and follow<br/>
•	ICG<br/>
•	Lexical analyzer<br/>
•	Operator precedence parser<br/>
•	Remove left recursion<br/>
•	3 address code<br/>
•	Code generation<br/>
•	Common subexpression elimination<br/>
•	LEX programs:<br/>
1.	Calculator<br/>
2.	Count no of characters, spaces, words, lines<br/>
3.	Count and identify vowels and consonants<br/>
4.	Count and identify tokens<br/>
5.	Count and identify uppercase and lowercase letters<br/>
